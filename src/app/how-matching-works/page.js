This ensures brokers who can handle your complete insurance needs score higher than those who can only partially help.'

              Brokers who are dedicated construction specialists — meaning construction insurance is their primary focus rather than one of many categories — receive an additional 2 point bonus. This reflects the real-world advantage of working with a broker who lives and breathes your industry.

              A broker must score at least 3 points to appear in your results. This means a broker with no relevant trade experience, no matching cover types and no state presence will never appear — even if no strong matches exist. We would rather show you fewer results than show you irrelevant ones.

              We do not score brokers based on how much they pay us, how long they have been on our platform, or any other commercial factor. A broker cannot pay to appear higher in your results. Rankings are determined entirely by the four signals above.

              This tool is designed to help you find relevant brokers faster — not to replace professional advice. Once matched, contact your broker directly and ask them to explain what cover is right for your specific situation. Always read their Financial Services Guide before proceeding.
